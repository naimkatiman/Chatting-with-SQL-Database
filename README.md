# Chatting with SQL Database 🗣️💬

Ever wished you could just talk to your database? Now you can! This project brings natural language processing to your SQL queries, making data retrieval as easy as chatting with a friend.

## 🌟 Features

- **Natural Language Interface:** Type like you talk, get data like a pro!
- **SQL Query Generation:** We do the heavy lifting, translating your words into SQL.
- **Interactive Jupyter Environment:** Because who doesn't love a good notebook?
- **Flexible and Adaptable:** Fits like a glove on different databases and query types.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x (because we're not living in the past)
- Jupyter Notebook (for that interactive goodness)
- SQLAlchemy (our trusty SQL toolkit)
- OpenAI or Hugging Face Transformers (the brains of the operation)
- Any SQL database (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL - take your pick!)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naimkatiman/Chatting-with-SQL-Database.git
   cd Chatting-with-SQL-Database
   ```

2. Install the magic ingredients:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your SQL database and tweak the connection details in the notebook.

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Fire up Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `Chat_with_SQL.ipynb` and let the fun begin!

3. Start chatting with your database using plain English. It's that simple!

## 💡 Example

Imagine this conversation with your database:

You: "Show me all the customers who made a purchase last month."

Database: "Sure thing! Here's what I found:"

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers 
WHERE purchase_date >= '2023-07-01' AND purchase_date <= '2023-07-31';
```

*[A wild table appears, showing all the lucky customers who shopped last month]*
